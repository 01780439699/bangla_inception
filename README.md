This project's front end is built using html, css and js. And i have used python flask framework as the server of the data. The front end takes the user input and gives it to the python server.
And for the recognition of the  characters i have trained a machine learning model using keras Library with python. The dataset used to train this recognition model is BanglaLekha Isolated.
